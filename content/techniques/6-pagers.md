# What is it ?

In a letter to shareholders, founder and CEO Jeff Bezos reveals that company execs “don't do PowerPoint” or any other slide-oriented presentations. Instead, “Amazonians” create six-page narrative memos that are read at the beginning of each meeting—kind of like a “study hall” session, he says.

# Why ?

We currently use this style in all our open source projects. The objective is to have a clear and objective vision of what our projects are capable of, objectives, values and lessons learned in a summarized way.
